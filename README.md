## jUnitySystems

This package contains a set of systems that serve as a game-agnostic foundation for managing application flow in Unity projects that utilize additive scene loading with scene groups.

### Features

- [Audio](./Audio.md): Sound and music management.
- [Core](./Core.md): Foundational elements for initializing and running the application.
- [Data](./Data.md): Runtime data management.
- [Debugging](./Debugging.md): Debugging utilities.
- [EventChannels](./EventChannels.md): Allows for decoupled cross-scene communications via Scriptable Object based event channels.
- [GameFlow](./GameFlow.md): Controls game flow via game state transitions.
- [GameState](./GameState.md): Contains game state definitions and coordinates transitions between them.
- [SceneControl](./SceneControl.md): Handles additive scene loading and unloading.
- [ServiceControl](./ServiceControl.md): Inversion of control via a service locator. Foundational to the entire application flow.

### Installation

Add the following to your `manifest.json`:
```json
"io.jimothy.junitysystems": "git+https://github.com/itsJimothy/Unity-Systems.git"
```

Or import via Unity Package Manager with the following URL:
`https://github.com/itsJimothy/Unity-Systems.git`

#### IMPORTANT
This package has two GitHub dependencies. Unity packages are not allowed to specify GitHub dependencies in `package.json`. (Unity projects can specify GitHub dependencies in `manifest.json` which Unity packages don't have. [See relevant documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-git.html). I know it sounds dumb, and it's really annoying but here we are.)

See installation links to the dependencies below.
